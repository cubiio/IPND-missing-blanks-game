# Missing Blanks Game

## Introduction
This was a project in my Udacity **Intro to Programming Nanodegree**. 

The purpose of the project was to:
* to introduce object oriented programming and then to learn by doing in this project 
* solidify Python concepts and code taught in the modules leading up to the project

## Getting Started
The code is in _Python_ and the game is run in the command line. 

### To get started:
* Load up the Terminal
* `cd` to the folder where the code is located
* In the command line enter `missing-blanks-game.py` 
* The game will run, just follow the in-game prompts 

## Usage examples
* The game includes three levels, 4 missing words for easy, 8 missing words for medium, and 12 for hard
* The game can be adapted by replacing the text in the `easy_text` / `medium_text` / `hard_text` variables, along with the corresponding answers in the `easy_answers` / `medium_answers` / `hard_answers` variables 

## Other
* This code was added retrospectively i.e. repo created and uploaded after the project as I was not using Git/GitHub at the time. 
* This is why the code is revision number 5 but there is only one commit (at time of writing).
